# Clean architecture proposition for python

Repository to propose clean archi oriented code architecture for python around a simple library project.

## Why ?

I love python and clean architecure so I will try to express different options to combine both of them
for your projects that I came across and used and found nice to use.

I am not a well versed clean python developper and every proposition can and will be ammended as
time pass. Fell free to comment and propose your owns.

## Python and the clean architecture

One of my first impression while trying to use the low amount of knowedge I add on clean
architecture with python was that it was well designed for it.

I met clean arch with Golang, witch revolves arround the interfaces concepts and it
seemed to me that abstract definitions of classes should be a requirements in clean arch.

But it is not. Clean arch aims to cleanly distinguish how we communicate to the user, what we wish
the user to be able to do, and how we are doing it. It nevers enforces abstraction like interfaces
if they are not usefull or not well fiting the langage.
